# My very first webpage!

Well that took from the example.

I have archived the original readme from the code institute pack to just a text file so its able to be seen if need be.

## Project

Using three html files and a css, running through and understanding the different technologies that the 3 streams are going to use.

Three .html pages using lots of div's, classes, external links and images. 

I have looked further than the project and stored the images in a folder that is then referenced on the source
of the link and shows up the pictures nicely.

A css file, lots of simple things but nicely tied together and still getting my head round a lot of things.

Had to make a few minor changes, putting all the files in a 'hello-world' folder with this didnt seem to work. maybe i will
explore this more in the future and understand exactly how github handles displaying and whaty website link/page link.

*figure out how to remove the deleted files fromt he git status....
